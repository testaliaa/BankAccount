This application serves the role of a standard bank teller. 
Here we have a Bank Account, a Checking Account, and a Savings Account
Bank Account is serving as the parent class, and Checking Account and Savings Account are inheriting its properties and methods. 
The Accountable interface serves the purpose of holding the getBalance method, allowing the CreditCard class and BankCustomer class to access the method along with the account classes.
There are rules in place for the Bank. If all of the Bank Customer's total assets amounts to 25,000 or more, the customer is considered VIP status. 
The CreditCard class does not inherit from the Bank Account class, but the balance does play a role in determining a bank customer's VIP status.
